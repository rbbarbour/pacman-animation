# Pacman Animation
## Description
This is an animation of Pacman that I made as part of an exercise in the MIT Full Stack Development with MERN course.  This exercise taught me how to alternate images using an array and have the image move and switch directions based on the page boundaries.
## Installation
No installation required, just a simple html file with corresponding animations.
## Support
Reach me on twitter @rbbarbour for support.
